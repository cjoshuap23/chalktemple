    <p>I'm Crue Pehrson, a student at BYU-Idaho pursuing a major in Software Engineering. I enjoy learning and using technology and plan to develop great software in my career. I love to play sports, go camping, and spend time with family and friends. My family is the most important thing to me in life. I have two younger brothers and two younger sisters, which makes us seven, including my parents. I am so lucky to have them! </p>
    <p>I love being a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and I consider it one of my greatest privileges! It helps me to keep my focus on Jesus and become something better. My favorite scripture is Matthew 7:7, which helps me know that God is there to help me in this learning process called life. </p>
